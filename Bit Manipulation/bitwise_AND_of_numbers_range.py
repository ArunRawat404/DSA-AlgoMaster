    Bit Manipulation Reduction

    Intuition:
        The bitwise AND (&) of a range will only keep the bits that are 1 in all numbers in that range.
        As soon as a bit flips anywhere in the range, that bit position becomes 0 in the final answer.

    Time Complexity: O(log n), as we are shifting bits right until left and right are aligned
    Space Complexity: O(1)

    Shift Right

    Intuition:
        When we bitwise AND a range like [m, m+1, ..., n], only the leftmost common bits will survive. Any bits that change between m and n will become 0 in the final result.

    Time Complexity: O(log n), as we are right-shifting the numbers, which cuts their size roughly in half each time. So at most, we'll do about logâ‚‚(n) shifts.
