    Using Bitmasking

    Intuition:
        We use two variables, `ones` and `twos`, to track the numbers that have appeared exactly once and exactly thrice, respectively.

        For each number in the array:
        - Update `ones`: add the new bits to it, unless those bits are already in `twos`.
        - Update `twos`: add the new bits to it, unless those bits are already in `ones`.
        - At the end, `ones` contains the bits of the number that appeared exactly once.

    Using Bitwise Counting

    Intuition: 
        For each bit position (0 to 31), count how many numbers have that bit set.
        Since every number except one appears 3 times, all bit counts should be divisible by 3 â€” except for the unique number's bits.
        Use bitwise OR to construct the result from bits where count % 3 != 0.
